## Resource Usage

### Memory

| State | RAM Used | RAM Available | Swap Used |
|-------|----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Initial** | 1.1 GB | 831 MB | 959 MB |
| **5 Tickets Running** | 1.7 GB | 591 MB | 1.2 GB |
| **10 Tickets Peak** | 1.6 GB | 652 MB | 1.6 GB |
| **Final (Idle)** | 974 MB | 1.3 GB | 1.2 GB |

### CPU Load Average

| State | 1 min | 5 min | 15 min |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| **Initial** | 0.21 | 0.40 | 0.72 |
| **5 Tickets** | 1.71 | 1.24 | 1.00 |
| **10 Tickets Peak** | 4.68 | 2.30 | 1.42 |
| **Final** | 2.85 | 2.39 | 1.55 |

### Claude Processes

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Max Concurrent Processes** | 5-6 |
| **Peak Claude Memory** | 1,334 MB |
| **Daemon Memory** | ~12 MB |
| **Flask Web App Memory** | ~17 MB |

## Observations

### Positive
1. **Stability**: System remained stable throughout the test with no crashes
2. **Parallel Processing**: Successfully processed 3-5 tickets simultaneously
3. **Memory Recovery**: System recovered memory after task completion
4. **Auto-Backup**: Each ticket execution created automatic backup before changes

### Areas of Note
1. **Swap Usage**: Heavy swap usage (up to 1.6 GB) indicates RAM constraints
2. **Load Spikes**: Load average reached 4.68 (high for 6-core system)
3. **Variable Duration**: Task duration varied significantly (15s to 304s)

## Recommendations

### For 2 GB RAM Systems
- Limit `MAX_PARALLEL_PROJECTS` to 2-3
- Monitor swap usage
- Consider adding more swap space

### For Production Use
- **Minimum RAM**: 4 GB recommended for comfortable operation
- **Optimal RAM**: 8 GB for handling multiple concurrent projects
- **Swap**: At least equal to RAM size

## Conclusion

The Fotios Claude system successfully processed 10 tickets across 4 projects with full parallel execution. While the 2 GB RAM system showed strain (high swap usage, elevated load), it remained stable and completed all tasks without errors. For production environments with frequent parallel processing, 4+ GB RAM is recommended.
