# Telegram Notifications Setup

Get instant alerts on your phone when Claude needs your attention.

## Step 1: Create a Telegram Bot

1. Open **Telegram** on your phone
2. Search for **@BotFather** and open it
3. Send `/newbot`
4. Enter a **name** for your bot (e.g., `Fotios Claude Alerts`)
5. Enter a **username** for your bot (must end in `bot`, e.g., `fotios_claude_bot`)
6. BotFather will send you a message with your **token** - copy it

   ```
   Use this token to access the HTTP API:
   7123456789:AAHk5JxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxYYY
   ```

## Step 2: Start a Chat with Your Bot

1. Click the link BotFather gave you (t.me/your_bot_username)
   - Or search for your bot's username in Telegram
2. Press **Start** or send `/start`
3. **Important:** Send one more message (e.g., type "hello" and send)
   - This is required for the next step to work

## Step 3: Get Your Chat ID

1. Open this URL in your browser (replace `<TOKEN>` with your actual token):

   ```
   https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates
   ```

2. You'll see JSON text. Look for:

   ```json
   "chat":{"id":123456789,"first_name":"Your Name"...}
   ```

3. The number after `"id":` is your **Chat ID** (e.g., `123456789`)

## Step 4: Configure in Settings

1. Go to your **Dashboard** (`https://YOUR_IP:9453`)
2. Click the **⚙️** button (top right, near Logout)
3. Enter your **Bot Token**
4. Enter your **Chat ID**
5. Select which notifications you want:
   - ✅ Ticket completed
   - ⏳ Awaiting input (recommended)
   - ❌ Ticket failed (recommended)
   - ⚠️ Watchdog alert (recommended)
6. Click **Test Notification**
7. Check your Telegram - you should receive a test message
8. If successful, click **Save Settings**

## What You'll Receive

| Event | When |
|-------|------|
| ⏳ **Awaiting Input** | Claude finished a task and needs your review or response |
| ❌ **Task Failed** | Something went wrong during execution |
| ⚠️ **Watchdog Alert** | A ticket appears stuck (repeated errors, no progress) |

## Example Notification

```
⏳ Task Completed - Awaiting Review

📁 Project: MyWebsite
🎫 Ticket: WEB-0042

Add user authentication to the login page
```

## Troubleshooting

### "getUpdates shows empty result"
- Make sure you sent `/start` AND one more message to your bot
- Wait a few seconds and refresh the page

### "Test notification not received"
- Double-check your Bot Token (no extra spaces)
- Double-check your Chat ID (numbers only)
- Make sure you started a chat with your bot

### "Chat ID not found in getUpdates"
- Send another message to your bot
- Refresh the getUpdates URL

## Two-Way Communication

You can reply directly to notifications in Telegram!

### Reply to Add a Message

When you receive a notification, simply **reply** to it with your message. The system will:
1. Detect which ticket you're replying to
2. Add your message to the ticket conversation
3. If the ticket was "awaiting input", it reopens automatically

### Ask Questions with "?"

Start your reply with `?` to ask a quick question without reopening the ticket:

```
?what's wrong
?τι δεν πάει καλά
?status
```

The system will:
1. Use Claude Haiku to generate a short summary
2. Send the answer back to your Telegram
3. NOT reopen the ticket (stays in current status)

This is useful for quickly checking on progress without triggering Claude to work again.

### Examples

| Your Reply | What Happens |
|------------|--------------|
| `fix the login bug` | Message added, ticket reopens, Claude starts working |
| `?what's the error?` | You get a short summary, ticket stays as-is |
| `looks good, thanks` | Message added, ticket reopens |
| `?τι γίνεται` | Summary in Greek, ticket stays as-is |

## Notes

- Notifications are sent instantly when ticket status changes
- Settings are saved in `/etc/codehero/system.conf`
- The daemon restarts automatically when you save settings
- You can disable notifications anytime from the Settings panel
- Two-way communication polls every 10 seconds
- Questions use Claude Haiku for fast, low-cost responses
